# 👋 Hi, I’m Ibrahim Arshad  
### 🚀 AI Engineer in Progress

I’m building a strong foundation in modern Generative AI systems, with a focus on how things actually work in production — prompt design, retrieval pipelines, evaluation, and backend APIs. I care less about flashy demos and more about correctness, grounding, and clear system behavior.

My focus is not just using tools — but **understanding how things work under the hood**, building end-to-end systems, and developing production-ready AI applications.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning & Building

### 🔹 AI Engineering Stack
- **Python** for ML & AI workflows  
- **LangChain & LangGraph** for multi-step reasoning and agents  
- **Hugging Face** (models, tokenizers, fine-tuning concepts)  
- **Vector databases** & embeddings  
- **APIs & backend integration** for AI apps  

## Current projects
**[Multi-source RAG system](https://github.com/ibrahim1023/multi-source-rag-system)** — an end-to-end document Q&A platform with hybrid retrieval (vector + keyword), grounding with citations, refusal behavior, and evaluation tooling. Designed as a production-style system rather than a demo.

**[Prompt Playground](https://github.com/ibrahim1023/prompt-playground)** — a structured environment to experiment with prompt engineering techniques such as few-shot prompting, schema-validated outputs, retries, and guardrails, with an emphasis on reliability and testability.

My goal is to grow into a Generative AI Engineer role, working on systems that are reliable, explainable, and maintainable.

*(Projects are being built iteratively and added as they reach production quality.)*

## 🧩 How I’m Preparing to Get Hired

I’m intentionally following an **AI Engineer path**, not a “prompt-only” path:

- ✅ Strong ML fundamentals  
- ✅ Hands-on GenAI projects  
- ✅ Clean, documented repositories  
- ✅ Realistic problem statements (not toy demos)  
- ✅ Production thinking (scalability, reliability, evaluation)

My goal is to be **job-ready**, not tutorial-ready.

## 📌 Current Focus
- Building a solid GenAI portfolio  
- Deepening understanding of LLM internals & workflows  
- Writing clean, well-documented AI code  
- Preparing for AI / GenAI engineering interviews
