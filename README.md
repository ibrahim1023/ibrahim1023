# 👋 Hi, I’m Ibrahim Arshad  
### 🚀 AI Engineer in Progress

I’m an aspiring **AI / Generative AI Engineer** actively building real-world projects while mastering the foundations required to get hired in AI engineering roles.

My focus is not just using tools — but **understanding how things work under the hood**, building end-to-end systems, and developing production-ready AI applications.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning & Building

### 🔹 Core AI Foundations
- Machine Learning fundamentals (loss functions, gradient descent, optimization)
- Model evaluation, data pipelines, and experimentation
- Practical understanding of how models learn, not just how to call APIs

### 🔹 Generative AI & LLM Engineering
- Prompt engineering (system prompts, tool usage, structured outputs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LLM application design patterns
- Model orchestration and agent workflows

### 🔹 AI Engineering Stack
- **Python** for ML & AI workflows  
- **LangChain & LangGraph** for multi-step reasoning and agents  
- **Hugging Face** (models, tokenizers, fine-tuning concepts)  
- **Vector databases** & embeddings  
- **APIs & backend integration** for AI apps  

---

## 🛠️ Projects I’m Working On

### 🤖 GenAI Portfolio Projects (In Progress)
- AI assistants with memory & tool usage  
- RAG systems using documents & embeddings  
- Multi-agent workflows for reasoning & task execution  
- End-to-end AI apps (from data → model → API → UI)

*(Projects are being built iteratively and added as they reach production quality.)*

## 🧩 How I’m Preparing to Get Hired

I’m intentionally following an **AI Engineer path**, not a “prompt-only” path:

- ✅ Strong ML fundamentals  
- ✅ Hands-on GenAI projects  
- ✅ Clean, documented repositories  
- ✅ Realistic problem statements (not toy demos)  
- ✅ Production thinking (scalability, reliability, evaluation)

My goal is to be **job-ready**, not tutorial-ready.

## 📌 Current Focus
- Building a solid GenAI portfolio  
- Deepening understanding of LLM internals & workflows  
- Writing clean, well-documented AI code  
- Preparing for AI / GenAI engineering interviews
