# 👋 Hi, I’m Ibrahim

I’m a software engineer focused on **deterministic systems, AI reliability, and production-grade GenAI tooling**.

I like building things that reduce ambiguity: explicit workflows, clear contracts, reproducible runs, and systems that are easy to reason about and debug.

## 🚧 Current Projects

#### [ci-rootcause](https://github.com/ibrahim1023/ci-rootcause) — Deterministic Multi-Agent CI Debugging Engine [In progress]
An ADK-based multi-agent system that analyzes failed CI runs using failure graphs, diff-correlation, and deterministic root-cause ranking.
Generates structured RCA artifacts with computed confidence — not just LLM summaries.

#### [llmdiff](https://github.com/ibrahim1023/llmdiff) — Deterministic LLM Regression & Diff Testing Tool [In progress]
A framework for comparing LLM outputs across prompts, models, and versions with structured diff analysis and reproducible scoring.
Designed to detect silent behavior changes, prompt regressions, and output drift in production LLM systems.

#### [llmflow-core](https://github.com/ibrahim1023/llmflow-core) — Deterministic LLM Workflow Engine
A production-ready SDK for building deterministic, multi-step LLM workflows with strict execution guarantees and structured reasoning.
Focused on reliability, reproducibility, and eliminating hallucination-prone agent loops.

## 🧪 Learning Projects

The following projects were built to **explore and stress-test ideas** around AI workflows,
determinism, and reasoning systems.

---

### [Multi-Source RAG System](https://github.com/ibrahim1023/multi-source-rag-system)  

An implementation of a retrieval-augmented generation system that aggregates results from
multiple data sources before generation.

- Focus: RAG architecture, grounding, and retrieval composition
- Explored trade-offs between single-source vs multi-source retrieval
- Helped build intuition for reliability issues in RAG pipelines
---

### [Prompt Playground](https://github.com/ibrahim1023/prompt-playground)  

A structured playground for experimenting with **prompt engineering techniques** and
understanding how prompt changes affect model behavior.

- Focus: prompt iteration, structure, and constraints
- Emphasis on reproducibility and clarity over ad-hoc prompting
- Reinforced the importance of treating prompts as versioned artifacts
---

### [Deterministic Multi-Step Reasoning Engine](https://github.com/ibrahim1023/deterministic-multi-step-engine)  

A prototype engine exploring **deterministic step execution**, explicit control flow, and
state propagation across multi-step reasoning pipelines.

- Focus: deterministic execution and step orchestration
- Highlighted limitations of generic step engines for LLM workflows
- Directly informed the design philosophy behind `llmflow-core`
---

## 🎯 Current Interests

- Deterministic and auditable AI systems
- LLM reliability, validation, and evaluation
- AI developer tooling & infrastructure
- Production-grade GenAI architectures
