# 👋 Hi, I’m Ibrahim

I’m a software engineer focused on **deterministic systems, AI reliability, and production-grade GenAI tooling**.

I like building things that reduce ambiguity: explicit workflows, clear contracts, reproducible runs, and systems that are easy to reason about and debug.

## 🚧 Current Project

### [llmflow-core — Deterministic LLM Workflow Engine](https://github.com/ibrahim1023/llmflow-core)
**Status:** In active development

A **library-first**, deterministic workflow engine for running LLM-powered pipelines as
explicit, human-readable steps — with schema validation, replayable runs, and audit-friendly artifacts.

**What it focuses on**
- Deterministic execution (no autonomous agent loops)
- Explicit, file-defined workflows (YAML + prompt files)
- Schema-enforced LLM outputs (fail fast on violations)
- Reproducible runs with persisted artifacts
- Designed to plug into existing AI applications

This project is built with production constraints in mind: predictability, debuggability,
and human control over execution.

## 🧪 Completed Learning Projects

The following projects were built to **explore and stress-test ideas** around AI workflows,
determinism, and reasoning systems. They are complete learning projects and are no longer
under active development.

---

### [Multi-Source RAG System](https://github.com/ibrahim1023/multi-source-rag-system)  

An implementation of a retrieval-augmented generation system that aggregates results from
multiple data sources before generation.

- Focus: RAG architecture, grounding, and retrieval composition
- Explored trade-offs between single-source vs multi-source retrieval
- Helped build intuition for reliability issues in RAG pipelines
---

### [Prompt Playground](https://github.com/ibrahim1023/prompt-playground)  

A structured playground for experimenting with **prompt engineering techniques** and
understanding how prompt changes affect model behavior.

- Focus: prompt iteration, structure, and constraints
- Emphasis on reproducibility and clarity over ad-hoc prompting
- Reinforced the importance of treating prompts as versioned artifacts
---

### [Deterministic Multi-Step Reasoning Engine](https://github.com/ibrahim1023/deterministic-multi-step-engine)  
**Status:** In active development

A prototype engine exploring **deterministic step execution**, explicit control flow, and
state propagation across multi-step reasoning pipelines.

- Focus: deterministic execution and step orchestration
- Highlighted limitations of generic step engines for LLM workflows
- Directly informed the design philosophy behind `llmflow-core`

## 🎯 Current Interests

- Deterministic and auditable AI systems
- LLM reliability, validation, and evaluation
- AI developer tooling & infrastructure
- Production-grade GenAI architectures
